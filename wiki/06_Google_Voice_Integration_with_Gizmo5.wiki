#summary How to use Gizmo5's native Google Voice integration tools.
 
After a torrid build-up of interest in Gizmo5 as the only provider with SIP access to Google Voice, Gizmo5 introduced some integration with Google Voice. Recognizing that Google Voice directly competes with and undercuts their long distance calling product, Gizmo5 added some configuration settings to the user accounts, allowing users to specify their Google Voice credentials. Then, users would initiate an outbound call through Gizmo5's own systems, not Google's. The Gizmo5 servers would then interact with the Google Voice servers to initiate an outbound call but connect the call to the Gizmo5 user who initiated the call. Because of the direct competition, Gizmo5 limited calls inititated in this way to 3 minutes in length.<p>

Gizmo5 did not limit the length of calls that arrived inbound from the Google Voice servers, however. This means that all calls arriving into Gizmo5 accounts from Google Voice are unlimited in length. Recall that when Google Voice users initiate outbound calls by entering or selecting phone numbers at the web site, Google Voice always proceeds by calling the user first at a number they specify, only to connect the user to the desired phone number when they answer the call. From the very beginning, Google Voice users with Gizmo5 accounts have been able to make calls of unlimited length over SIP merely by initiating the calls at the Google Voice website.<p>
 
Since SIP is a computer-to-computer communication system, this means that users with devices capable of SIP communication can now enjoy free unlimited calling by authenticating their SIP client against their SIP account at Gizmo5 and initiating outbound calls via the Google Voice website and indicating to Google Voice that they can be reached through their Gizmo5 phone line. This also means that devices that have not historically been thought of as telephones can now serve their users in that role.<p>
