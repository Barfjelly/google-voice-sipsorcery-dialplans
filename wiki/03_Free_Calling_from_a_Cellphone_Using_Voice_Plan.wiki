#summary How to make free phone calls while using your cellular voice plan

Central to Google Voice is the ability to manage your phone calls and SMS text messages. Just as when using your landline, Google Voice can also help you mask your personal cellphone number to other parties,showing them just one phone number for reaching you. With a little planning (and a little cooperation from cellphone companies), Google Voice can help you turn your cellphone into a flat-rate, unlimited use phone line. There are generally two ways this can be achieved.<p> 

Cellphone usage is priced differently in the US from almost every other country. In general, US cellphone users are charged minutes for both incoming and outgoing calls. The same is true for text messages, although unlimited text messaging plans have been available across all of the major carriers for many years. To help retain and build their customer bases over the years, cellphone companies began by offering unlimited calling to other cellphones operating on the same network. Even that wasn't even enough eventually, and companies began allowing customers to select a handful of out-of-network phone numbers and designate them as effectively being "in network". The out-of-network numbers don't have to be other cellphones or landlines -- users can generally pick any set of numbers they like, and they will never be charged for the minutes used during calls to or from the numbers on the list.<p>
 
As described above, there are two ways in which calls involving the Google Voice Number selected by a Google Voice user can be used to branch out to free calls to any other phone number in the US free of charge. First, the user can access the Google Voice website and enter or select a number they want to call. Google Voice will then call the user at the phone number where the user indicated they can be reached, showing a caller id of the user's own Google Voice number. When the user answers the incoming call they will be connected to the phone number entered or selected at the Google Voice website, free of charge.<p>
 
Alternatively, if the user does not want to use the Google Voice website or does not have a smartphone capable of browsing the web, the user may still dial their own Google Voice number. Google Voice will recognize the call as coming from a phone that is managed by the user, and will offer to play any waiting voicemail or connect them to another number. The user may press 2 and then enter another phone number to which they will be connected free of charge. It may become a hassle for users to dial phone numbers by hand every time they want to make a phone call. Since their introduction, cellphones have always had the ability to have keystroke sequences programmed into telephone numbers stored for address book entries.<p>
 
Two important programming codes available for numbers are the "pause" and the "wait". When a pause is inserted into a phone number, the cellphone will dial the portion of the phone number leading up to the pause. Then for each pause inserted into the stored number, the phone will wait 2 seconds before continuing on to dial the remaining numbers. When a wait is inserted into a code, the phone will again call the phone number stored ahead of the wait code, but instead of waiting a certain amount of time prior to dialing the remaining numbers, the phone will wait for the user to press a key to signify to the phone that is okay to proceed in dialing the remaining numbers.<p>
 
iPhone users who want to simplify dialing but weren't able to grab the official Google Voice dialer have another option. There is a free app called Prefix Dialer. The app can be configured to automatically prepend a dialing sequence in front of the numbers to be dialed when calling an entry in the phone's address book. Once the app is installed, go into the settings, and enter this special sequence:<p>
 
Enter your Google Voice phone number, the letter "p", your pin, another letter "p", the number 2, another "p", and optionally the number 1 (the final "1" seems to speed up dialing a bit, but is not required).<p>
 
For example, if your GV number is 555-666-7777, and your pin is 9999 then you would enter "5556667777p9999p2p1". Then, whenever you want to place a call go into Prefix Dialer & tap "select number".  The app then shows you your normal iPhone contact list. Select a contact and dial like you normally would. When the call is placed the app will dial your prefix first, then the number you selected, thus routing the call through your Google Voice account.<p>
 
Separately, there are options for Google Voice users who don't have a smartphone (or a data plan for their smartphone) but still want to enjoy free calling without typing 11 digits for every outbound call. The solution is to update the phone numbers for each of their contacts, starting with the most frequently called ones. Instead of just having the person's phone number listed, the Google Voice user will update the number to read their own Google Voice number, plus either a wait or a long enough series of pauses, the number 2, another pause or two, and finally the number that was originally stored in that memory location. This restores even "low tech" Google Voice users' ability to make unlimited free outbound calls with little inconvenience.<p>
 
It should be noted, however, that any frequently called numbers that are on the Google Voice user's cellular network should not be changed. As Google Voice is not a cellphone service, the parties receiving calls from new Google Voice users will now be charged minutes to receive phones they have never been charged to receive before.<p>
 
So by simply adding their own Google Voice number to their "Calling Circle", Google Voice users have two options for making unlimited outbound calls without consuming any talk minutes allocated to their account. One way requires a drastic change in the way in which phone calls are placed by forcing users to visit a website instead of their own local address book. The other way either requires a significant amount of extra button presses at the start of each call or the systematic editing of every frequently called number in the user's address book that is not a mobile phone on the user's own cellular network.<p>
 
In addition, Google Voice has an option to further extend the benefits of this approach. By going into the configuration settings of their Google Voice account, users are able to decide what is shown on their caller ID when a call arrives through the Google Voice system. Users may choose to see the actual caller ID presented by the caller, or simply mask all incoming calls behind the Google Voice number. When calls arrive on the user's Google Voice line, calls presented to the user with the user's own Google Voice number as the caller ID will cause the user's carrier to recognize that number as being in their calling circle and therefore free.<p>
 
There is a third way in which users can enjoy unlimited calling. On select smartphones, particularly those running Google's Android operating system and RIM's Blackberry phones, Google has released software that simplifies outbound dialing. The user brings up an alternate dialer, which still typically has access to the user's local address book stored on their smartphone. When the user chooses a number to dial, the alternate dialer performs two steps in parallel. First, the dialer uses the phone's Internet connection to notify Google Voice's servers that a call is about to arrive from the user's cellphone and the message includes the phone number they are actually trying to reach. Then the dialer triggers the phone to call an entirely different, unpublished number to log into the Google Voice system. Once the Google Voice system has processed the message sent previously by the alternate dialer, the system answers the inbound call coming from the user's cellphone and connects the caller to the number they originally specified in the alternate dialer.<p>
 
This is significant because there's no way for users to know which Google Voice "access number" the user's handset is going to call and yet, this number has to be detected by the user and added to the user's calling circle. If the user does not figure out this access number and add it to their calling circle, they will be under the misconception that all of their outbound calls are free, when in fact they are not.<p>
 
When Google Voice users with calling circles add their Google Voice number (and the access numbers used by smartphones) to their calling circle and choose to have Google Voice display their own Google Voice number as the caller ID on incoming calls, they are now able to make and receive unlimited calls with their cellphones under certain conditions:<p>
 
  #) The cellphone is on their carrier's home network (i.e. not roaming),
  #) The user always uses a dialing method that routes calls through the Google Voice servers and all entrance numbers are listed in their calling circle,
  #) Parties calling the user call them through their Google Voice number,
  #) The user maintains at least the minimum calling plan that qualifies for calling circles
 
Users should note that the access number dialed by the alternate dialer on Android and Blackberry phones is subject to change at any time, and it is the user's responsibility to ensure that the access number being dialed matches the number on their calling circle for that purpose. The alternate dialer on Blackberry phones does not entirely mask the calling process from the user. Once the dialer transmits the target phone number to the Google Voice servers over the Internet, the dialer app initiates a standard phone call, allowing the user to see the standard screen displayed while a call is in progress.<p>
 
With this in mind, a common suggestion given to Blackberry users is to create an entry in the phone's local address book for Google Voice. The two numbers stored in that entry would be the user's own personal Google Voice number as well as the access number they detect as being called by the alternate dialer. The user may also go as far as adding a picture to the entry, such as this one found here:<p>

Doing so makes it very easy for Blackberry users to recognize when the access number has changed since the "Call In Progress" screen will simply show a phone number instead of the name "Google Voice" and the icon displayed above will not be shown. When the icon and name are not displayed on outbound calls initiated by the alternate dialer, the user will know that the access number being dialed by the dialer app is not on their calling circle and the outbound calls will not be free of charge until the new number is added to the calling circle.<p>
 
The alternate dialer on Android phones apparently mask the entire process of dialing the access number, therefore making it a bit more difficult to identify the access number being dialed. Furthermore, adding that number and the caller ID picture above to an entry created for Google Voice is of no value since the standard "Call In Progress" screen is not displayed.
