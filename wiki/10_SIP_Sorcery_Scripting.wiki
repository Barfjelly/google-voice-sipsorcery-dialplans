#summary An introduction to Ruby scripting at SIP Sorcery.

Key to taking advantage of SIP Sorcery's capabilities is their scripting feature. It is important to remember in all this that SIP is just a method for enabling computers to exchange audio (and other information) in a way that is compatible with what people know as "telephone calls". The scripts that SIP Sorcery supports are called dial plans. Dial plans instruct SIP Sorcery on how to route calls based on a variety of parameters. Only outbound dial plans are needed for integration with Google Voice.<p>
